        <Subtitle>Who can read my private notes?</Subtitle>
        <Text>
          Quite simply: no one but you. Not us, not your ISP, not a hacker, and
          not a government agency. As long as you keep your password safe, and
          your password is reasonably strong, then you are the only person in
          the world with the ability to decrypt your notes. For more on how we
          handle your privacy and security, check out our easy to read{' '}

        <Subtitle>Can I collaborate with others on a note?</Subtitle>
        <Text>
          Because of our encrypted architecture, Standard Notes does not
          currently provide a real-time collaboration solution. Multiple users
          can share the same account however, but editing at the same time may
          result in sync conflicts, which may result in the duplication of
          notes.
