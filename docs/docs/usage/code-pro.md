## Keyboard Shortcuts

Perform these shortcuts with the editor

| Action                                                          | Shortcut                                         |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| Toggle word wrap between `on` and `off` (bounded is unaffected) | <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd>                    |
| Format code with Prettier^                                      | <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> |
| Toggle Tab Key Moves Focus (vs tab spacing)                     | <kbd>Ctrl/âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd>                 |

^ For CSS, GraphQL, Markdown, HTML, JavaScript, Less, TypeScript, Sass, and Yaml. Some languages, such as JSON, have built-in formatters.

Each time the editor refreshes (e.g., toggling word wrap, formatting code), the editor remembers your position (line number and column) and centers it on the screen if it's not already in focus.

## Settings

The settings for each note are saved automatically after they are changed. Loading default settings will sync the note's settings with the default settings and save automatically.

### Themes

The Monaco Editor comes with three themes: `vs` (a white/light theme), `vs-dark` (a dark theme like the default theme for VS Code), and `hc-black` (a high contrast dark theme). There is also one more option: `sn-theme`. The `sn-theme` option takes either `vs` or `vs-dark` depending on your system theme and adjusts some of the colors (e.g., link colors) to match the theme. The `sn-theme` is still a work-in-progress.
