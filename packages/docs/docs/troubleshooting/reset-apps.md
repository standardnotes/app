If you are experiencing issues with signing in to the apps, you may want to clear the app’s storage. Before proceeding, please sign in to the [web](https://app.standardnotes.org) app (in a different browser, if needed) to confirm that notes, tags, and other items on your notes syncing account that were modified or created on another device were saved and synced to our servers.

:::warning
If you do not have an account, do not proceed with these steps until a fix has been made available. You may have some luck in simply entering in your password or passcode several times until the app unlocks.

## Mobile

**Please note:** Reinstalling the app on mobile devices may download a backup of your app from the cloud and you might run into the same issue again. Clearing the cache alone is usually not enough to reset the app. If you have an [account](https://app.standardnotes.org) with us and can verify that your changes have synced, then clearing the app's storage will not result in the loss of your notes.

### [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.standardnotes&hl=en_US)

1. Locate the Standard Notes app in the app drawer.
2. Press and hold the app’s icon until a small menu appears.
3. Tap on **App Info**.
4. Locate and use the option to delete/clear the app’s storage (and cache).
5. Relaunch the app and sign in again.

**Please note:** Do not reinstall the app afterwards.

### [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/standard-notes/id1285392450)

1. Please open the **Settings** app, and navigate to your iCloud backups with the following path:
   **[Your name and iCloud account username (at the top)] → iCloud → Manage Storage → Backups → [Tap on the correct device]**
2. Wait for the list of apps to load.
   - Tap on “Load all/more apps” if necessary and wait for the list to expand once more
3. Finally, locate the Standard Notes app and tap on the toggle button to remove the current and all future backups of the app from iCloud.
4. From there, please reinstall the app and sign in again.
   - You can enable the setting to backup the app to iCloud again, if you would like.
