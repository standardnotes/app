            Open Standard Notes on your mobile device and sign into your home server by specifying the sync server URL
            during sign in. The URL will be the Tailscale-based IP address of this computer, followed by the port number
            of your home server. For example, if your computer Tailscale IP address is 100.112.45.106 and your home
            server is running on port 3127, your sync server URL will be http://100.112.45.106:3127.
