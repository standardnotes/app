This application makes use of the core JS/CSS/HTML code found in the [web repo](https://github.com/standardnotes/app). For issues related to the actual app experience, please post issues in the web repo.

## Running Locally

Make sure [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) is installed on your system.

```bash
yarn setup
yarn build:web # Or `yarn dev:web`
yarn dev

# In another terminal
yarn start
```

We use [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) to validate commit messages.
Before making a pull request, make sure to check the output of the following commands:

```bash
yarn lint
yarn test # Make sure to start `yarn dev` before running the tests, and quit any running Standard Notes applications so they don't conflict.
```

Pull requests should target the `develop` branch.

### Installing dependencies

To determine where to install a dependency:

- If it is only required for building, install it in `package.json`'s `devDependencies`
- If it is required at runtime but can be packaged by webpack, install it in `package.json`'s `dependencies`.
- If it must be distributed as a node module (not packaged by webpack), install it in `app/package.json`'s `dependencies`
  - Also make sure to declare it as an external commonjs dependency in `webpack.common.js`.

## Building

Build for all platforms:

- `yarn release`

## Building natively on arm64

Building arm64 releases on amd64 systems is only possible with AppImage, Debian and universal "dir" targets.

Building arm64 releases natively on arm64 systems requires some additional preparation:

- `export npm_config_target_arch=arm64`
- `export npm_config_arch=arm64`

A native `fpm` installation is needed for Debian builds. `fpm` needs to be available in `$PATH`, which can be achieved by running

- `gem install fpm --no-document`

and making sure `$GEM_HOME/bin` is added to `$PATH`.

Snap releases also require a working snapcraft / `snapd` installation.

Building can then be done by running:

- `yarn setup`

Followed by

- `node scripts/build.mjs deb-arm64`

## Installation

On Linux, download the latest AppImage from the [Releases](https://github.com/standardnotes/desktop/releases/latest) page, and give it executable permission:

`chmod u+x standard-notes*.AppImage`
