                  Using local storage, your account keys may be more easily accessible by third-party programs, unlike
                  in your password manager which has additional protections built-in.
                </p>
                <p class="sk-p">
                  In either cases, the strongest way to protect your account keys is to use a strong passcode, which
                  will be used to encrypt your keys and prevent any software or operating system from reading them.
                  <strong> If you plan on setting a passcode, you can safely use local storage. </strong>

                  Note that
                  <strong>
                    granting access to your system password service will allow Standard Notes to read, write, and
                    delete <em>any</em> of your saved passwords.
                  </strong>
                  Standard Notes will never use this privilege to do anything more than reading and writing to its own
                  entry.
