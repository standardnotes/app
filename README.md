### Self-hosting the web app

Our web app is compiled into a folder of static HTML, JS, and CSS files. You can serve these files behind a web server to get started:

1. `git clone https://github.com/standardnotes/app.git`
2. `cd app`
3. `yarn install`
4. `yarn build:web`
5. `cd packages/web`
6. You can then use Python to serve this folder over http: `python -m http.server 8080`

You can now access the app at `http://localhost:8080`.
