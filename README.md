# Standard Notes
### A safe and private place for your life's work.

Standard Notes is a simple and private notes app available on most platforms, including Web, Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android. It focuses on simplicity, and encrypts data locally before it ever touches a cloud. This means no one can read your notes but you (not even us).

### Docker setup

Docker is the quick and easy way to try out Standard Notes. We highly recommend using our official [Docker hub image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/standardnotes/web).

### Standalone instance

Before you start make sure you have a `.env` file copied from the sample `.env.sample` and configured with your parameters.

If your intention is not contributing but just running the app we recommend using our official image from Docker hub like this:
```
docker run -d -p 3001:3001 --env-file=your-env-file standardnotes/web:stable
```

Or if you want to use the `develop` branch that is in a work-in-progress state please use:
```
docker run -d -p 3001:3001 --env-file=your-env-file standardnotes/web:latest
```

You can then access the app at `http://localhost:3001` (please check Docker container logs if the server has started already and is listening on connections).

### Running Locally

**Instructions:**

1. Ensure you have [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com) installed
2. Clone the repo
3. `yarn install`
4. `yarn start`

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:3001`.

You can also set the `DEFAULT_SYNC_SERVER` environment variable to set the default server for login and registration.

```
DEFAULT_SYNC_SERVER=https://sync.myserver
```

## Contributing

For contributing we highly recommend you use our docker-compose setup that is provided in this repository.

### Docker compose setup

Use the included [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file to build Standard Notes with `docker-compose`. Once your `.env` file has been copied and configured, simply run:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This should load the app container and run the necessary scripts. You should then be able to reach the app at `http://localhost:3001`
