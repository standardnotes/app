- [ ] Remove sn-models dependency in favor of directly embedding SNSmartTag models. The reason is that there appears to be a [breaking change](https://github.com/standardnotes/snjs/commit/20d1099a86ad7ade3da54a17b29c85df15e0ce35#diff-b9cfc7f2cdf78a7f4b91a753d10865a2) in sn-models (which is now known as snjs) 0.1.14 where dummy: true is added to all smart tags. This causes an issue with all smart tags being duplicated as regular tags (see issue #41). The temporary solution was to downgrade sn-models to last compatible version.
