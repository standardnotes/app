# Markdown Pro Editor

The Markdown Pro Editor (formerly Advanced Markdown Editor) is a Standard Notes derived editor that offers full support for Markdown editing.

This editor is based on [EasyMDE](https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor), which is a fork of the now unmaintained [SimpleMDE](https://github.com/sparksuite/simplemde-markdown-editor).
